    <p><strong>Hi!</strong>
        <br><br>
        I’m Juste Derkintyte, and I’ve recently embarked on my journey
        to learn web development. With a background in various service jobs
        and a career as an athlete, my interest in technology and
        programming has always been a part of my life. Growing up, I
        enjoyed playing video games and solving computer problems with
        my dad. This passion led me to explore my skills in the engineering
        program at Umeå University. However, after a year, I realized
        something was missing.
        <br><br>
        I found myself repeatedly visiting the Yrgo Web Developer page,
        unsure if I would even get accepted due to the competitive nature
        of the program. To my surprise, I was accepted, and now I proudly
        say I’m one step closer to becoming a web developer.
        <br><br>
        In addition to my studies, I pursue my passion for beach volleyball,
        a sport that has shaped my life and taught me valuable lessons
        in communication and teamwork. I look forward to the exciting
        journey ahead in web development!
    </p>
